This document is currently a **work in progress**. I hope to explain the implementation of thislang in some detail so you can write your own if you wish.

That was the original goal of this project, to write a detailed multi-part tutorial going through the implementation of each component of thislang. At some 5500 lines of code, that's a challenging task to undertake. But hopefully until I do that, this document can at least provide an overview of thislangs implementation.
